# MSFS-Lighting-Improvements
Edited the default lighting files for Landing and Taxi Lights
These are the global lights settings so all planes will change to be BRIGHTer than default.

Default Location:
<MSFS Install Path>\Official\OneStore\fs-base-effects-legacy\effects
1. Back up existing lighting files
2. Extract - overwrite those files.
